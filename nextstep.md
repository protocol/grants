# Next Step Grants

What happens after the hackathon?

You signed up, met some like-minded people and formed a team, and actually got a proof of concept working. Maybe you even won a prize! But now it's Monday, the event is fading, you're all going back to work... but you just can't the idea out of your head. Maybe if you had a little more time your project could be a bit more polished, have that one last feature that would fullfill the promise of the vision. Maybe that would get it far enough along to make a compelling pitch and nab a small investment. Maybe you could turn that weekend project into an actual business...

Next Step grants are to help you with that extra bit of time after the hackathon ends, and connect you with subsequent opportunities to continue your journey. If your hackathon project uses IPFS, Filecoin or libp2p, Protocol Labs will fund your team to continue working on the project for one month.

All you need to do is sign up, add your project to the community showcase, give a short weekly update on progress and write a summary at the end of month period.

## Program Qualifications

This program is currently open to teams of the [ETHGlobal NFTHack](https://nft.ethglobal.co/) hackathon who submitted for any prize category, who meet the following requirements:

* Filecoin, IPFS or libp2p was used in the project stack, either directly or through a framework, library or service
* Team size is a maximum of five members
* Project is open source, under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Reporting requirements

Update your team's community showcase entry once per week during the 30 days.

Conclude the 30 day period with a report using the provided template, which contains:

* Summary of progress during the month
* List of challenges encountered
* What the next steps for the project are
* Interest in further grants or investment

## Grant distribution

Each team member will receive 2000USD worth of FIL once, issued within 30 days of acceptance to the program, using the value of FIL at the time of payment issuance.

All payees are required to provide:

* name
* mailing address
* email address
* phone number
* FIL wallet address
* Github account
* A completed US IRS W8 or W9 form

Team membership may not change after acceptance to the program - those that join afterwards are not eligible for the grant.

## How to apply

Gather the following information for your application:

* URL to your hackathon submission, proving you're the team
* Description describing how IPFS, Filecoin or libp2p are used in the project, and URL to Github repo and relevant code
* List of all team member information: name, mailing address, phone number, FIL wallet address, Github account and a completed US [IRS W8 (outside US)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8) or [W9 (resident of US)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9) form

Application steps:

1. Follow the steps in the [ipfs/community](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/README.md#ecosystem-projects) Github repository to add your project profile - this entails creating a pull request with a markdown file that contains your project information
2. [Register your project](https://airtable.com/shrjwvk9pAeAk0Ci7) for the IPFS ecosystem database
3. Fill out this [VERY SHORT survey](https://airtable.com/shrDZMizx03jOa4mQ) about your hackathon project
4. Email dev-grants@protocol.ai with 1) a link to the PR above, and 2) the team contact information so we can provide payment instructions

## FAQ

* Q: Are other hackathon submissions that use the qualifying technologies accepted?
  * A: Not yet, but we are evaluating expanding the program to more events in the future

* Q: My project uses OrbitDB, Textile or other framework, not IPFS directly, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes

* Q: My project publishes data or files to IPFS, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes

* Q: My project saves data to, or retrieves data from the Filecoin network, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes

* Q: Do you pay out in other currencies besides FIL?
  * A: No

* Q: Can we have more than five people on our team?
  * A: Yes! However, the maximum grant distribution is $2k of FIL per person, for up to five people. After disbursement, the individual is full control of the funds and can do what they like with them.

* Q: Can someone join the team who was not part of the original hackathon? Or can I switch with someone? Or can only a subset of the original team still participate?
  * A: Yes! All team permutations are ok as long as these two requirements are met: 1) only one submission per original hackathon project 2) at least one original hackathon participant must be a member of the team

* Q: I'm not a coding participant, I just coordinated or made videos or helped in other ways - am I eligible?
  * A: YES! In real life, successful products are the result of many roles, skills, backgrounds and disciplines... not just coding. You are an INSTRUMENTAL part of your team, and are eligible to receive the grant.

* Q: What if we don't finish the 30 days and run off with the money?
  * A: You will carry the weight of your decision for the rest of your days, and be reborn in the next life as a hungry ghost.
