# Next Step Grants

What happens after the hackathon?

You signed up, met some like-minded people and formed a team, and actually got a proof of concept working. Maybe you even won a prize! But now it's Monday, the event is fading, you're all going back to work... but you just can't the idea out of your head. Maybe if you had a little more time your project could be a bit more polished, have that one last feature that would fullfill the promise of the vision. Maybe that would get it far enough along to make a compelling pitch and nab a small investment. Maybe you could turn that weekend project into an actual business...

Next Step grants are to help you with that extra bit of time after the hackathon ends, and connect you with subsequent opportunities to continue your journey. If your hackathon project uses IPFS, Filecoin or libp2p, Protocol Labs will fund your team to continue working on the project for one month with $5000 worth of Filecoin (FIL).

All you need to do is sign up, add your project to the [IPFS community showcase](https://github.com/ipfs/community/tree/master/projects), create a [discussion thread](https://github.com/ipfs/community/discussions) for your project, and give a short weekly update on progress and write a summary at the end of month period.

## Program Qualifications

This program is currently open to teams of the [ETHGlobal NFTHack](https://nft.ethglobal.co/), Cal Hacks hello:world, Chainlink, CivHacks, GameDevJ, and ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum hackathons who submitted for Protocol Labs prize categories, and who meet the following requirements:

* Filecoin, IPFS or libp2p was used in the project stack, either directly or through a framework, library or service
* Team size is a maximum of five members (or more, but only five grant recipients)
* Project is open source, under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Reporting requirements

Update your team's community showcase entry once per week during the 30 days.

Conclude the 30 day period with a report using the provided template, which contains:

* Summary of progress during the month
* List of challenges encountered
* What the next steps for the project are
* Interest in further grants or investment

## Grant distribution

Each team will receive 5000USD worth of FIL once, issued within 30 days of acceptance to the program, using the value of FIL at the time of payment issuance.

The payee of the grant is required to provide the information below, submitted to a form we will provide:

* name
* mailing address
* email address
* phone number
* Filecoin (FIL) wallet address
* A completed US IRS W8 or W9 form (See W8/9 section below)

The designated payee may not change after acceptance to the program. The designated payee is responsible for further distribution if the team has more than one member.

## FAQ

* Q: Are other hackathon submissions that use the qualifying technologies accepted?
  * A: Not yet, but we are evaluating expanding the program to more events in the future

* Q: Is there a deadline to apply for the grant, after the hackathon I participated in ends?
  * A: Not at this time, however we expect to institute a rule at somepoint - possibly "within 30 days of event end" or something like that.

* Q: My project uses OrbitDB, Textile or other framework, not IPFS directly, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes

* Q: My project publishes data or files to IPFS, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes

* Q: My project saves data to, or retrieves data from the Filecoin network, does it qualify?
  * A: Yes

* Q: Do you pay out in other currencies besides FIL?
  * A: No

* Q: Should I send the payment information and W8/9 forms to you over email?
  * A: No. We will reply with a form where you can submit that information

* Q: Which Filecoin wallet should I use?
  * A: Any valid Filecoin address can be used. You can read more about Filecoin wallets [in the documentation](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/#wallets). We are not responsible for any use of the FIL once the deposit has been made to the wallet address you provide to us.

* Q: When is the Filecoin payment made, at what price, and will I be notified?
  * A: Protocol Labs processes Filecoin payments twice monthly, and there is a validation period for transactions, so typically you will not have to wait longer than three weeks once your PR has been merged. The Filecoin price at the end of the prior day is used to determine the amount, however this may vary based on market conditions. You will receive an email notifying you that your deposit has been made.

* Q: Can someone join the team who was not part of the original hackathon? Or can I switch with someone? Or can only a subset of the original team still participate?
  * A: Yes! All team permutations are ok as long as these two requirements are met: 1) only one submission per original hackathon project 2) at least one original hackathon participant must be a member of the team

* Q: I'm not a coding participant, I just coordinated or made videos or helped in other ways - am I eligible?
  * A: YES! In real life, successful products are the result of many roles, skills, backgrounds and disciplines... not just coding. You are an INSTRUMENTAL part of your team, and are eligible to receive the grant.

* Q: What if we don't finish the 30 days and run off with the money?
  * A: You will carry the weight of your actions for the rest of your days, and may be reborn in the next life as a hungry ghost.
