[**Fleek**](https://fleek.co) is an Open Web developer platform with everything you need to build sites and apps on the new web and the underlying protocols that power it (Ethereum, IPFS, Filecoin, the Internet Computer and more). From hosting, storage, gateways, domains, and more, Fleek has everything you need to seamlessly build and manage Open Web sites & apps. Also builders of Space, the user-controlled, encrypted, and open source storage platform!

The Fleek team will be awarding a total of $7,500 (USDT) to projects building on top of the [Space SDK library](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-sdk), primarily, and using other Fleek tools ([Fleek hosting, storage UI, Storage JS](http://fleek.co/)) to complement the development.

- 1st Prize - 1 team ($2,000 + Protocol Labs matching)
- 2nd Prize - 3 teams (each $1,000 + Protocol Labs matching)
- 3rd Prize  - 5 teams (each $500 + Protocol Labs matching)

##### The Challenge:
Fleek invites developers to build using the open source [Space SDK](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-sdk) library, a JavaScript/Typescript modular set of interfaces for building web and native applications leveraging protocols like IPFS, Textile, GunDB, and forth, powering their storage -for example- with distributed storage on IPFS/Textile infrastructure.

1) **Innovation Track**
- Build a Dapp using the Space SDK in Creative & Innovative Ways.
- The Space app can be used as reference of known use cases on the SDK that should be avoided for originality (e.g. storage platform, file sharing, etc.).

2) **NFTs Track**:
- Build an NFT-related Application Leveraging the Space SDK
- Build an NFT-focused Dapp or project that leverages the SDKs storage or other modules to, for example, store NFTs distributedly.

3) **Communication Track**:
- Build a Communication Dapp Powered by the Space SDK
- Explore building a communication platform (chat/social/etc.) using the Space SDK to create alternatives that leverage from user-owned storage, or other pieces of the SDK.

##### Guidelines for Submission:
- All projects must have a working implementation of the Space SDK.
- A quick summary video and Github repository must be submitted.
- A usable demo must be available for use/easy build.

##### Judging Basis:
- Originality in implementation (new format, or app type)
- Capability of leveraging the SDK (usefulness, quality)
- General design and good UX practices (experience, usability)
