## Textile Bounties

$12,500 in prizes (in FIL) + 100% matching from PL

For further details on all bounties below see [**Textile's Bounty Overview**](./textile-bounties.md).

##### **Miner Index Tools and Visualizations**

Textile recently launched the Filecoin Miner Index, a comprehensive miner storage performance history and real-time index for the Filecoin network.

- **Miner Index Visual Explorer** ($2500 + Protocol Labs matching)
- **Best Ethereum-based Oracle built on the Miner Index** ($2000 + Protocol Labs matching)

##### **Filecoin Storage Use-cases**

We're focused on three areas of development that we think are particularly well-suited to adopt Filecoin today. We want to see projects that work to store these datasets using online deal storage through [Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/), [Lotus](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/lotus/installation/), or Textile's [Bucket Archiving API](https://docs.textile.io/buckets/archiving/).

- **Best Video App on Filecoin** ($1500 + Protocol Labs matching)
- **Best Collaboration Tool on Filecoin** ($1500 + Protocol Labs matching)

##### ThreadDB and Buckets

Threads allow you to connect multiple databases (or users) and keep data in-sync across Libp2p. Buckets are one of the first applications built on Threads. Buckets provide an easy way to sync folders of data over Libp2p and accessible over IPFS. We provide remote services to host, relay, and persist Threads and Buckets for users.

- **Best App using Threads** ($1500 + Protocol Labs matching)
- **Threads Benchmarks and Metrics** ($1500 + Protocol Labs matching)
- **Best Use of Bucket Pinning API** ($1500 + Protocol Labs matching)

##### Community Enablers

We want to fund educational and onboarding tools for the ecosystem.

- **React Boilerplates for Buckets and Filecoin APIs** ($500 + PL matching)
