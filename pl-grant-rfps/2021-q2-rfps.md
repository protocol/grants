# RFPs for IPFS and Filecoin from Protocol Labs

Protocol Labs is seeking proposals for the following RFPs for IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p.

### Improved Garbage Collection in IPFS

#### Overview

Improve the performance characteristics of GC of unpinned content in IPFS and support the remove of specific content. Flexibility in supporting various GC strategies would be ideal.

#### Description

When storage is reclaimed by removing unpinned blocks, garbage collection requires stopping other IPFS activities for its duration, and can take significant time. For pinning users at scale, this can take “literally days” for a single node and large pin sets can become expensive in both memory and time. Garbage collection needs to operate differently to reduce the impact on IPFS. A request from multiple users is to be able to remove specific content from an IPFS node. Currently, GC removes all unpinned blocks. It would be useful for GC to be able to remove all blocks associated with a specific DAG along with upgrades to reference counting.

After this project, these specific pain-points will be resolved:

- GC takes too long for nodes with large pin sets
- Need to GC content when it becomes unpinned
- Need to be able to remove specific content

This project has been technically scoped. To learn more about the proposed approach [see the full proposal](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/blob/771c5a1d51ceef5ffd9e1d5303fd0a9617cd41c0/proposals/new-ipfs-gc.md) as well as [conversation](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/8).

### S3 Interface to Filecoin

#### Overview

So that existing users of the S3 API can easily port their existing archive and retrieve workflows from S3 to Filecoin/IPFS.

#### Description

Proposals should include an initial analysis of the most common and logical API calls to support. Exploration of interesting features that have good analogies to Filecoin such as Requester Pays Buckets are ideal.

Proposals that port an existing S3 workflow or UI (e.g. freezeapp) and can dogfood the API in a demo application right away are also desired. One potential interesting demo application is an S3 to Filecoin/IPFS migration tool targeting 500 GB or less.

Applicants should demonstrate prior experience using the S3 (Glacier) API in an application, open source examples of SDKs or APIs they have created as well as understanding of Filecoin/IPFS data structures.

Deliverables:

- An S3 wrapper for Filecoin/IPFS
- A demo that can store and retrieve data via ANY S3 client or Filecoin using the S3 wrapper

**Note:** A current dev grantee is exploring a [Min.io](https://min.io) integration with Filecoin, which provides an S3 API among a number of other convenience features.

For implementation approaches [see the proposal](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/blob/45763163912ac6b6e19c28a40cbe1ec9ebaca5ac/proposals/34-aws-s3-facade.md).

### Filecoin PubSub Observatory

#### Overview

A tool, script or tutorial to set up monitoring for miner GPU, CPU, memory and other resource and performance metrics, ideally using Prometheus and Grafana or other common open source tools.

#### Description

This could help miners
