### Improved Garbage Collection in IPFS

#### Overview

Improve the performance characteristics of garbage collection of unpinned content in IPFS and support the removal of specific content. Flexibility in supporting various GC strategies would be ideal.

#### Description

When storage is reclaimed by removing unpinned blocks, garbage collection in IPFS currently requires stopping other node activities for its duration, and can take significant time. For pinning providers with pins at scale, this can take “literally days” for a single node. Large pin sets can become expensive in both memory and time. Garbage collection needs to operate differently to reduce the impact on IPFS.

An additional request from users is to be able to remove specific content (e.g. spam) from an IPFS node. Currently, GC removes all unpinned blocks. It would be useful for GC to be able to remove all blocks associated with a specific DAG along with upgrades to reference counting.

As a result of this project, these specific pain-points will be resolved:

- GC content when it becomes unpinned
- GC specific content
- GC takes too long for nodes with large pin sets

This project has been technically scoped. To learn more about the proposed approach [see the full proposal](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/blob/771c5a1d51ceef5ffd9e1d5303fd0a9617cd41c0/proposals/new-ipfs-gc.md) as well as [PR conversation](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/8).

### S3 Interface to Filecoin and IPFS

#### Overview

A multitude of storage applications support the S3 REST API interface. Support an S3 Interface to Filecoin and IPFS so that existing users of the S3 API can easily their port existing archive and retrieve workflows.

#### Description

Proposals should include an initial analysis of the most logical API calls to support. Exploration of interesting features that have good analogies to Filecoin such as [Requester Pays Buckets](https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3) are welcome. Projects should leverage Filecoin/IPFS data structures and meta indexing considerations.

Proposals that additionally port an existing open source S3 workflow or UI (e.g. [Freezeapp](https://www.freezeapp.net/)) and can dogfood the API in a demo application are highly desired. One potential interesting demo application is an S3 to Filecoin/IPFS migration tool targeting 500 GB or less.

Deliverables:

- An S3 wrapper for Filecoin/IPFS
- A demo that can store and retrieve data via ANY S3 client or Filecoin using the S3 wrapper

**Note:** A current dev grant project is exploring a [Min.io](https://min.io) integration with Filecoin, which provides an S3 API among a number of other convenience features. A previous Min.io integration with IPFS was also explored by [RTradeLtd/s3x](https://github.com/RTradeLtd/s3x).

For a discussion of implementation approaches [see the proposal](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/blob/45763163912ac6b6e19c28a40cbe1ec9ebaca5ac/proposals/34-aws-s3-facade.md).

### Filecoin PubSub Observatory

#### Overview

Observability into the network's pubsub activity would help improve the visibility of block propagation and network health in the Filecoin network. Moreover, a reputation system for Filecoin peers would help node operators check and debug networking issues. 

#### Description

A community dashboard can help with understanding, debugging, and improving the system overall. Pubsub activity can include:

  - message flows
  - peer scores
  - low-level RPCs (that can be processed to extract higher-level insights)

Using this tool, a protocol engineer could trace block propagation through the network, or a node operator could check their node's score and eventually reputation. 

#### Effort estimate
- Small, 2-3 weeks
