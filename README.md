***Learn more about project ideas and bounties in the [gitcoin-gr9-hackthon/all-prizes](https://github.com/protocol/grants/blob/main/gitcoin-gr9-hackathon/all-bounties.md).***

Protocol Labs is a co-sponsor of the [Gitcoin GR9 Hackthon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr9/).

To amplify the ability of expert teams in our ecosystem to be co-creators and stewards, Protocol Labs has invited our ecosystem collaborators to submit RFPs and bounties they are funding.

Protocol Labs will match ecosystem collaborator prizes starting with the Gitcoin GR9 Hackathon.

### Filecoin Dev Grants - Wave 7

Proposals are **due March 31, 2021 at 23:59 PDT** for priority consideration

The [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) stewards the [Filecoin Dev Grants Program](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants).

Filecoin Dev Grants support open source developer tools, exploratory integrations and projects that can benefit the community at large. All submissions must be open sourced under Apache2 and MIT licenses.

Dev Grants Waves are quarterly and accepted on a rolling basis, although it's best to submit proposals before the quarterly deadline for priority budget consideration.

You can learn about current RFPs, how to apply via PR, and previously funded projects in the [Filecoin Dev Grants repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants).
