### Filecoin Dev Grants - Wave 8

Proposals are **due June 30, 2021 at 23:59 PDT** for priority consideration

The [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) stewards the [Filecoin Dev Grants Program](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants).

Filecoin Dev Grants support open source developer tools, exploratory integrations and projects that can benefit the community at large. All submissions must be open sourced under Apache2 and MIT licenses.

Dev Grants Waves are quarterly and accepted on a rolling basis, although it's best to submit proposals before the quarterly deadline for priority budget consideration.

You can learn about current RFPs, how to apply via PR, and previously funded projects in the [Filecoin Dev Grants repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants).

### Protocol Labs Contributor RFPs

Protocol Labs has a number of RFPs for projects related to core contributions to the IPFS and Filecoin complementary stacks, as well as developer tooling and supporting libraries.

Take a look at our current [Contributor RFPs](https://github.com/protocol/grants/blob/main/grant-rfps/contributor-grants.md) and contact dev-grants@protocol.ai if you're interested in learning more and contributing to one of these projects! We're looking to engage more developers to build core tools in our ecosytem.

### Next Step Grants

You made a proof-of-concept, but what now? What happens after the hackathon ends? How to take that side project from a hustle to your main thing?

The **Next Step grants program** lets you take the next step with your project - develop it a bit further, get it ready for an accelerator, incubator or investment. If you're building with IPFS or Filecoin, receive $5k in Filecoin (FIL) to help you take your project to the next level.
