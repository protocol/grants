### Filecoin Dev Grants - Wave 7

Proposals are **due March 31, 2021 at 23:59 PDT** for priority consideration

The [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) stewards the [Filecoin Dev Grants Program](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants).

Filecoin Dev Grants support open source developer tools, exploratory integrations and projects that can benefit the community at large. All submissions must be open sourced under Apache2 and MIT licenses.

Dev Grants Waves are quarterly and accepted on a rolling basis, although it's best to submit proposals before the quarterly deadline for priority budget consideration.

You can learn about current RFPs, how to apply via PR, and previously funded projects in the [Filecoin Dev Grants repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants).

### Next Step Grants

What happens after the hackathon? The Next Step grants program lets you take that next step with your project - develop it a bit further, get it ready for an accelator, incubator or investment. The pilot of this program is open to teams who participated in the ETHGlobal NFTHacks event. If that's you, [apply now](nextstep.md).
